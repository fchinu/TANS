### Results

Optimisation has been one of the main aspects we have worked on while developing this project. We wanted to deliver a fast, yet accurate simulation. We think we managed to obtain good results, with a full simulation and reconstruction of 1 million events being run in under 1:30 minutes. (CHECK TIME)
